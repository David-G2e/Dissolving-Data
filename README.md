Dissolving Data: Performing Inverse Fourier Transform on Dissolved Oxygen

This is the code for my senior thesis Dissolving Data: Performing Inverse Fourier Transform on Dissolved Oxygen. 
It consists of code that performs the Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) on data every second for approximately two weeks long.
This data is the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) on the lake floor of Lake Fryxell Antartica throughout varying depths.
